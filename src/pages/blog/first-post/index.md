I started this blog to improve both my writing and my thinking. It feels a little scary to be writing in public for everyone to see. And I think that because it somewhat scares me, it propels me to want to do it even more. 

I want to write about my endeavors in web development, software development, no-code, networked thinking, and topics of that sort.  

If you find some of this helpful or have advice feel free to message me.
